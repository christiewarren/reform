            <p>Over the course of the semester, our class has worked to bring this exhibition to fruition. We're not only excited to show you our final product, but also how we reached it!</p>

               <p>With the concept for the exhibition decided, the Branding Team started on the logo. As a class, we went back and forth between a few names for the exhibition. During this time, the Branding Team ran a brainstorming session with the class to help better understand the goals of our exhibition. After several logo variations and many rounds of ideating, sketching, and vectorizing, the Branding Team achieved our final mark.</p>

               <p>Once the logo was finalized, the Branding Team moved on to the brand guidelines. Included in the brand guide are the color scheme, typography choices, dos and don’ts, as well as general guidelines for poster imagery. The Branding Team also added a stencil aspect to the logo, allowing the mark to act as a window to imagery behind it. This element not only emphasized the concept, but also made the logo feel truly complete.</p>

               <p>To plan the structure and basic layout of each page, the Web Team began by creating wireframes. The team created several options for every page, keeping a consistent focus on gridded elements. At this stage, the Web Team also tested various CSS animations to determine their feasibility and planned imagery for the landing page. When selecting the final wireframes, the Web Team considered responsiveness, ease of use, interactivity, and relation to concept.</p>

               <p>The Exhibition Team was challenged with creating poster templates that would showcase us individually, while also maintaining cohesion and adhering to brand guidelines. After drafting several iterations, the team landed on a series of three different typography-based layouts. The series created a system in which three different poster layouts are able to connect in six different ways when displayed all together in a grid, but can also stand alone.</p>

               <p>After deciding what content was needed across social media, the Social Team began to create low fidelity wireframes for Instagram. These wireframes illustrated how each individual post would combine to create a full, connected design on the entire feed. At this stage, the Social Team laid out typographic elements and placeholder imagery—all in the brand colors—to create a balanced and cohesive Instagram page.</p>

               <p>To create excitement for the show, the Exhibition Team designed stickers with the logo and important links.

Because applying stickers in public spaces posed legality issues, the Exhibition Team created boxes to hold the stickers. These boxes were then given to downtown businesses so that customers could take the stickers while there.</p>

               <p>The Exhibition Team printed, cut, and sealed every poster with Mod Podge. Together with a few other volunteers, the team used a wheat-paste technique to hang the posters in downtown State College. This guerrilla-style marketing allowed us to promote our work and the exhibition itself beyond the Penn State campus, while still remaining Covid-safe. </p>
